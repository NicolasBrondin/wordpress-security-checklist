I created this project earlier this year inspired by a post on the group WordPress Brasil on Facebook ([read more here](http://www.rafaelfunchal.com.br/blog/wordpress-security-checklist/)) and made it quickly without considering its scalability and maintenance.

As I intend to create an English version and in order to make the content management easier, it would necessary to remove the content from the HTML code.

In short words:

> I don't want to rewrite unnecessary code.

So migrating to Jekyll was the best solution because I'll keep the project on Github :-)
